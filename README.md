CONTRIBUTE
----------

If you would like to contribute code to the ohmage android client you can do so through
GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

In general if you are contributing we ask you to follow the
[AOSP coding style guidelines](http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html).
If you are using an IDE such as Eclipse, it is easiest to use the
[AOSP style formatters](http://source.android.com/source/using-eclipse.html#eclipse-formatting). If
you are using Android Studio the default formatting should conform to the AOSP guidelines.

You may [file an issue](https://github.com/ohmage/android/issues/new) if you find bugs or would
like to add a new feature.
